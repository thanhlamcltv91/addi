This is a computing environment like Matlab and Octave, but made to work on Android devices.

The goal is for 100% compliance with how Octave works including a compatibility mode that makes the behavior more similar to Matlab (already very similar).

Please file a bug for anything that is different from Matlab or Octave vs. Addi that matters to you.  This will help me prioritize what features to go after next.

You can find Addi App here (if you cannot find it from your device):
https://market.android.com/search?q=pname:com.addi
AddiPlot is here:
https://market.android.com/search?q=pname:com.addiPlot

Octave home page is here:
> http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

Octave manual is here:
> http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/docs.html

Matlab home page is here:
> http://www.mathworks.com/

Current functions supported can be found here (ignore plotting functions):
> http://www.jmathlib.de/docs/handbook/index.php

Roadmap:

Build Octave for Android

Fix bugs and build decent GUI

As separate open source project working on plotting.  Specifically port gnuPlot is a likely route.
