## @deftypefn {Function File} {} null (@var{a}, @var{tol})
## Return an orthonormal basis of the null space of @var{a}.
##
## The dimension of the null space is taken as the number of singular
## values of @var{a} not greater than @var{tol}.  If the argument @var{tol}
## is missing, it is computed as
##
## @example
## max (size (@var{a})) * max (svd (@var{a})) * eps
## @end example
