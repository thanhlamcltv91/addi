## Description: Derivates of log-likelihood in logistic regression

function [dl, d2l] = logistic_regression_derivatives (x, z, z1, g, g1, p)

  ## first derivative
  v = g .* (1 - g) ./ p; v1 = g1 .* (1 - g1) ./ p;
  dlogp = [(dmult (v, z) - dmult (v1, z1)), (dmult (v - v1, x))];
  dl = sum (dlogp)';

  ## second derivative
  w = v .* (1 - 2 * g); w1 = v1 .* (1 - 2 * g1);
  d2l = [z, x]' * dmult (w, [z, x]) - [z1, x]' * dmult (w1, [z1, x]) ...
      - dlogp' * dlogp;
